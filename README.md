## CoCalc

[CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) is a cloud-based service that provides infrastructure and services that are useful for running courses based on Jupyter Notebooks.
It is used for [teaching by Universities around the world](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/wiki/Teaching).

Basic access, without internet access, is free; however, it is well-worth paying for premium access if you are going to support a class full of students or need internet access.
Paying users get more resources and support - vital if you are to rely on it for paying students.
